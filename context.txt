Can we implement something like below? (No need to implement now, can you take a look and investigate the capability when you have time?)\n\nPurpose is to not purchase SP that will be under utilized and not used.\n1. Have backend (Not visible from UI) settings to not purchase SP more than $〇〇 in one time. Ex) Don’t purchase SP that will exceed total cost of $50K in one purchase. \n2. If purchased SP has less than 30% utilization for 5 days in a row right after the purchase, auto refund or auto cancel the purchase (AWS has cancel policy for SP that if it’s before 7 days we can cancel the purchase) \n    a.

Just a quick question — who is the main target customer of Flow?\n• Ripple users: can access data at the payer level, but also receive recommendations for each linked account\n• or\n• Wave Pro users : where the payer info is hidden, each linked account is shown individually, and API access is granted at the linked account level\n• or\n•  Standalone Flow users — but the challenge here is that we’d need CUR access for their accounts\nRight now, it seems like the current setup primarily supports Ripple users, but we can adjust it depending on what makes the most sense.\n\nBy the way, we’re planning to show you the latest update tomorrow or Thursday for feedback!\n\ncc: <@<user>> <@<user>>"

I tried to finish the changes I have in mind for this ticket <https://app.clickup.com/t/903690/RPW-2050>, but it makes the code more complicated and disorganised. That's why I decided to separate the whole logic, stores, and components for the create and edit billing group to remove their dependencies on stores, components, and data mapping logics. I did a major refactoring on their shared forms and stores and made it more exclusive for both their processes and rendering operations. I haven't finished it, but give me maybe 2 more days, and I will be done with that. Also, <https://app.clickup.com/t/903690/RPW-2031> it will be done together with the ticket above since it will also be solved with the refactoring.\n\n<@<user>>, I tried implementing the subroutes and I was able to navigate to/create, /lists and /edit on billinggroup by exposing directly the parent components for the said paths for module federation. But that messed up the translation, maybe I need to check the language wrapper for that"

Then, in the Purchase Settings, they can run a simulation.\n*If the user decides to make a purchase for the first time*, still in the Purchase Settings, there would be another button to grant access for SP purchase (using CloudFormation template #2).\nFor any future simulations or purchases, they won’t need to go through the access setup again — we’ll just show the “Purchase SP” button.\nWe’ll also keep the Integration page, so users can still view or verify the access they’ve granted.\nWhat do you think?"

Right now, the currency is stored under the invoiceSettings object, which contains optional values like additional charges or discounts. Since invoiceSettings is optional, there are cases where this object may be null or not returned at all. As a result, if invoiceSettings is missing, the currency won't be available  which causes it to not show up on the Billing Group page. cc: <@<user>>"

Can we implement something like below? (No need to implement now, can you take a look and investigate the capability when you have time?)\n\nPurpose is to not purchase SP that will be under utilized and not used.\n1. Have backend (Not visible from UI) settings to not purchase SP more than $〇〇 in one time. Ex) Don’t purchase SP that will exceed total cost of $50K in one purchase. \n2. If purchased SP has less than 30% utilization for 5 days in a row right after the purchase, auto refund or auto cancel the purchase (AWS has cancel policy for SP that if it’s before 7 days we can cancel the purchase) \n    a.

- channel="help-customer_support", user="Rena", message: "<@<user>> I asked AWS Support about Convertible RI\n-----------------------------------------------\n1. When a Convertible RI is converted, does its ARN change?\n\nWhen a Convertible Reserved Instance (RI) is converted, its Amazon Resource Name (ARN) does change.\nThe ARN is a unique identifier for an AWS resource, and it includes information about the resource type, region, and other details. When you convert a Convertible RI, you’re essentially creating a new RI with different attributes, so it’s assigned a new ARN.\n\n\n2. If the ARN does change, which fields in the CUR should we refer to in the RIFee line items to associate the records before and after the conversion?\n\nWhen a Convertible Reserved Instance (RI) is converted, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the RI will change. To associate the Cost and Usage Report (CUR) records before and after the conversion, you can refer to the following fields:\n\n1. **LineItemId**: This field uniquely identifies each line item in the CUR. You can use this to track the same RI across the conversion.\n2. **ResourceId**: This field contains the ARN of the RI. Before the conversion, the ResourceId will reflect the original ARN. After the conversion, the ResourceId will reflect the new ARN.\n3. **ReservationId**: This field contains the reservation ID associated with the RI. The reservation ID will remain the same before and after the conversion, allowing you to link the records.\n4. **ReservationName**: This field contains the name of the RI. The reservation name will remain the same before and after the conversion, providing another way to associate the records.\n\nBy using a combination of these fields, you can effectively track the RI usage and costs before and after the conversion, even though the ARN has changed.\n\n\n3. Regarding converted RIs, my understanding is that the reservation/ModificationStatus will not be “Original”. Is this correct?\n\nYes, that is correct. When an Amazon EC2 Reserved Instance (RI) is converted, the ModificationStatus of the new RI will not be “Original”. Instead, it will be listed as “Conversion”.\n\nThe “Original” status is only used for RIs that have not been modified or converted. Once an RI is converted, the new RI will have a “Conversion” status to indicate that it was created through a conversion process, rather than being a brand new RI.\n\nThis is the expected behavior for converted RIs as of August 2023. The RI modification and conversion process can change over time, so it’s always a good idea to check the latest AWS documentation for the most up-to-date information on RI status and behavior."
